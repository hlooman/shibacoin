Shibacoin is a community focused cryptocurrency created by one of the original Dogecoin shibes from 2013. It was created for one purpose, to create a new and fun community just like the original Dogecoin community.

Unlike all iterations before it, Shibacoin is a layer 1 coin. This means there are no liquidity pools to drain, no blacklisting wallets, and no confusing smart contracts. Shibacoin is a simple blockchain.

The Shibacoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Shibacoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Dogecoin Core, Bitcoin Core, and other cryptocurrencies.

For information about the default fees used on the Shibacoin network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

## Dogecoin Differences

Shibacoin is a fork of Dogecoin. For the sake of familiarity, we will attempt to keep Shibacoin similar to Dogecoin. 

Changes:

* Addresses start with `S` instead of `D`
* BIPS features will start block 1000
* AuxPow starts at block 24,000 (Chain ID: 74)
* GUI themed for Shibacoin

## Usage üíª

To start your journey with Shibacoin Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by Shibacoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `shibacoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `shibacoin-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Ports

Shibacoin Core by default uses port `33864` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `33863` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   33864 |   44864 |   18444 |
| RPC      |   33863 |   44863 |   18332 |
